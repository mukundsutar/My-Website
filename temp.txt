Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle. It was bought by the New York Times Company in 2022.
Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. 

Features:
1. Sort Projects according to difficulty with flex order and blu filter

2. Some better animations

3. Some 3D component to the website
